   Argent is a premiere mobile wallet with integrations spanning from the Dai Savings Rate to Compound, Aave, Uniswap, Kyber, and more. It also features a novel Guardians mechanism to restore wallet access in the case of lost keys. It has experienced immense growth in the past year through paying users gas fees, a clever growth hack.

Where other wallets such as TrustWallet and Coinbase Wallet have stagnated, Argent has rapidly innovated and established itself as the premiere mobile wallet in just under a year by shipping new integrations almost monthly.

- Would including the organization as a Light Feed instill a sense of trust in the Oracles?

   Argent is a respected and trusted organization in the Ethereum ecosystem and their inclusion as a Feed would incite users to trust Maker's Oracles more. 

- Are there any public accussations of misconduct? How severe and numerous are they? Have they been confirmed?

    Oracle Team was not able to find any evidence of malicious conduct.

      No.

   Yes, the Oracle Team spoke to Itamar over video conference who is listed on LinkedIn as the CEO. This is further confirmed by the [U.K. Companies House register](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/11093638/officers) 

### Cost-Benefit
- Given the ratio of Dark Feeds : Light Feeds, does the Maker Protocol benefit from adding another Dark/Light Feed at this time?

   Yes, the Maker Protocol currently has 15 Dark Feeds and 9 Light Feeds. Adding another Light Feed would further balance the ratio.

- Given the extra cost of appointing a new Feed, does the benefit of the marginal security / marginal trust in the protocol exceed the cost?

Yes, the Maker Protocol currently has 24 Feeds. Adding another Feed would marginally increase Oracle security and resiliency.
