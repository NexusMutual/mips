## Disclaimer
MIP10 is meant to handle all of the Oracle related actions. Unfortunately MIP10 has inconsistencies and doesn’t conform to the monthly governance cadence that the Maker Improvement Proposal framework is built around. This has generated a backlog of Oracle proposals. While MIP10 is refactored to conform to the regular MIP process, Oracle proposals such as this one will utilize the more liberal weekly governance cycle. While strictly speaking this makes them not subproposals, they are included in the subproposal archive as a point of provenance to serve as a paper trail.

## Specification

### Introduction

If ratified, this subproposal would appoint Kyber Network as a Light Feed. Feeds submit data to the Oracles for the prices of assets. They are an important part of ensuring that the Oracles are reliable and secure. Only entities with strong credentials that the community trusts should be permitted to be an Oracle Feed.

> * Github: https://github.com/kybernetwork
> * Email: hello@kyber.network
> * Incorporated: British Virgin Islands
> * Domiciled: British Virgin Islands
> * Number of employees: 0
> * When was the organization founded? 21 March 2018
> * Who are the major investors in your organization? Kyber Network Reserves Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of Jedha Holdings Private Limited, a Singapore-incorporated entity. Funding is from Jedha Holdings.
> 
> * How much funding has the organization raised either privately or through a token sale? Jedha Holdings Private Limited’s subsidiary, Kyber Network Private Limited, also a Singapore-incorporated entity, raised 200,000 Ethers (equivalent to USD52m based on ETH:USD pricing at the close of the token sale) in an ICO that was completed in September 2017 in Singapore.

### Light Feeds

**Reputation**

- Does the organization have a strong reputation in the crypto community?

Yes, Kyber Networks has been one of the main contributors in the Ethereum space going as far back as 2017. They are one of only a handful of projects to be directly endorsed by Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum. Since their launch they’ve been one of the major liquidity providers in the DEX space and easily one of the most frequently used dapps.

- What contributions has this organization made to the crypto ecosystem?

The team’s main focus and contribution over the last 3 years has been building the Kyber Network protocol, an on-chain liquidity protocol that aggregates liquidity from a wide range of reserves and enables token exchange in any decentralized application. It also contributed through grants to Ethereum teams at very early stages (ie. Instadapp) and is an active member of the Ethereum community

- Would including the organization as a Light Feed instill a sense of trust in the Oracles?

It is the opinion of the Oracle Team that Kyber has a trustworthy reputation in the community and would further reinforce the reputation of the Maker Oracles.

- Are there any public accusations of misconduct? How severe and numerous are they? Have they been confirmed?

The Oracle Team was not able to find any record of confirmed cases of misconduct on account of the organization nor its executive staff.

**Verification**

- Were sufficient public-facing resources provided or found that confirm the information in the application?

Yes, public records were able to verify most of the provided information.

- Was the applicant honest with respect to:

- the investors

While the Oracle Team was not able to confirm that Kyber Network Reserves Limited is owned by Jedha Holdings Private Limited, it was able to confirm the existence and active status of Jedha Holdings Private Limited in Singapore through the Singaporean Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) with an address of 1 Upper Circular Road #050-01 Singapore 058400 and UEN 201803106C.

- how much funding was raised

The Oracle Team was able to confirm that 200,000 ETH was raised in an ICO in September 2017

- the number of employees

The Oracle Team was not able to verify the number of employees.

- the location of incorporation & domicile

The Oracle Team was able to verify the entity is domiciled in the British Virgin Islands through records supplied by the British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission.

- Given the applicant's major investors, is there a risk adding this Light Feed would give a single investor too much influence over the Oracle protocol?

No.

- Given the incorporation and domicile location of the organization, is there a risk adding this Light Feed would give a single jurisdiction too much influence over the Oracle protocol?

No.

**Identity**

- Did the Oracle Team get in contact with the organization to confirm their application?

Yes, the Oracle Team spoke to representatives from the Kyber Networks team over video conference who are listed on the organization’s website.

### Cost-Benefit

- Given the ratio of Dark Feeds : Light Feeds, does the Maker Protocol benefit from adding another Dark/Light Feed at this time?

Yes.

- Given the extra cost of appointing a new Feed, does the benefit of the marginal security / marginal trust in the protocol exceed the cost?

Yes.

### Oracle Team Recommendation

The Oracle Team recommends that Maker Governance ratify the proposal to appoint Kyber Network as a Light Feed for the Maker Oracles. Kyber Network has a strong brand and reputation in the ecosystem which are the primary requirements to look for in a potential Feed partner. The Oracle Team was able to verify the information provided by Deniz Omer in the MIP10c14 Light Feed application through government public records and cursory googling. No confirmed cases of misconduct related to the organization were found.
