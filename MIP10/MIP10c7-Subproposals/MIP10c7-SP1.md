## Specification

### Introduction

As markets and liquidity profiles evolve, it is important to revisit Data Models for collateral assets to ensure they accurately reflect the new normal. 

*This proposal adds FTX (ETH/USD) and Uniswap (ETH/USDC) as price sources for the ETH/USD Oracle and removes Bitfinex (ETH/USDT).*

### Supporting Evidence

DeFi has grown exponentially and Uniswap now does significant volume rivaling many centralized exchanges. Similarly, FTX has experienced remarkable growth and now boasts a significant Ethereum volume against USD. Meanwhile there is continued uncertainty over Tether's backing.


- What is better about the new Data Model?
This proposal would remove any dependency on USDT from the ETH/USD Data Model.
It also adds Uniswap as a source which as an AMM is very expensive for an attacker to manipulate.
