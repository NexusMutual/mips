## Disclaimer
MIP10 is meant to handle all of the Oracle related actions. Unfortunately MIP10 has inconsistencies and doesn’t conform to the monthly governance cadence that the Maker Improvement Proposal framework is built around. This has generated a backlog of Oracle proposals. While MIP10 is refactored to conform to the regular MIP process, Oracle proposals such as this one will utilize the more liberal weekly governance cycle. While strictly speaking this makes them not subproposals, they are included in the subproposal archive as a point of provenance to serve as a paper trail.

### Introduction
Gitcoin’s mission is to grow open source and help devs find new economic opportunities.

There are many ways to do this, and gitcoin offers a few different products to enable this:

- Virtual hackathons: Online & worldwide. Sponsors post prizes, and people compete to earn them by building stuff to the specifications.
- Grants: A better way to fund innovation in your ecosystem. Grantees can create a fundraising page for “the great work they’re already doing” in the space, then raise $$$ for that work.
- Ethical ads via CodeFund: An advertising network that respects your privacy. Codefund allows you to monetize your audience without selling them out.


### Community
- What has your organization contributed to the crypto community?

We have delivered almost $5mm worth of funding to OSS devs in the Ethereum community. https://gitcoin.co/results

- Successful products, services, tools, libraries, thought-leadership

I've also given talks at ETHDenver, ETHBerlin, Devcon, etc. https://owocki.com/public-speaking/

- How will the Maker Community benefit from your inclusion as a Light Feed?

We will be faithful & responsible stewards of the data passed into the MKR Oracle system.

Note that DAI/SAI are some of the most used tokens on the Gitcoin platform!  We have a rational economic incentive to keep the price data clean & good!  https://gitcoin.co/leaderboard/tokens?cadence=quarterly&keyword=all&product=all
