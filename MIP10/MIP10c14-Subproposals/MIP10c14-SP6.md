MyCrypto provides a client-side, open-source interface to the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to access and manage their ETH &

- How will the Maker Community benefit from your inclusion as a Light Feed?

MyCrypto has a solid track record of providing valuable products, resources, and infrastructure to the community. Many don’t realize it but 
we’ve been running our own infrastructure since 2017. This runs in our blood! We believe that we’d be a valuable addition to the others 
who are participating.
