### Summary

Unlike other regulated fiat-backed stablecoins, Tether stands out due to its unregulated nature and questionable backing. It makes little sense to hard-peg the value of USDT to $1 because there is no guarantee of solvency. This is in contrast to tokens like USDC, TUSD, or PAXOS which have much stronger guarantees. As such, the Oracle Team recommends a floating price USDT Oracle with active liquidations. 

Being one of the most highly traded tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem, there are a plethora of data to choose from. While high volume and liquidity are always high priority items for Data Models, the Oracle Team focused additional attention towards segregating the USDT price from outsized influence to any single pair. Out of the six total sources, two are against BTC, two are against ETH, and two are against USD. This minimizes the impact of price distortions driven exclusively by BTC or ETH though not necessarily a combination of the two. Similarly the Oracle is also resilient to manipulation of lower liquidity fiat pairs on BitFinex and Kraken.
