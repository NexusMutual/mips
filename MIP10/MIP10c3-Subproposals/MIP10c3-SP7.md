### Summary

As a regulated fiat-backed stablecoin, PAX can be treated similarly to the manner the Maker Protocol handles USDC and TUSD. This is a relatively safe operation due to the redeemable guarantees of PAXOS for the underlying USD as well as the regulatory and legal guarantees surrounding the deposit trusts.

This fixed value is meant to incentivize Dai generation as there is no risk of liquidation. Similarly this mechanism protects the Maker Protocol from triggering short-sighted liquidations when short-term blips such as a flash crash arise in the market when the $1 peg should soon thereafter recover in most circumstances.
