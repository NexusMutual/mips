## Disclaimer

MIP10 is meant to handle all of the Oracle related actions. Unfortunately MIP10 has inconsistencies and doesnâ€™t conform to the monthly governance cadence that the Maker Improvement Proposal framework is built around. This has generated a backlog of Oracle proposals. While MIP10 is refactored to conform to the regular MIP process, Oracle proposals such as this one will utilize the more liberal weekly governance cycle. While strictly speaking this makes them not subproposals, they are included in the subproposal archive as a point of provenance to serve as a paper trail.

## Specification

### Introduction
The dYdX team plans to use the oracle in an ETH-USD Inverse Perpetual trading pair (https://github.com/dydxprotocol/perpetual). They are currently using the BTC-USD oracle for a BTC-USD Vanilla Perpetual (https://trade.dydx.exchange/perpetual/BTC-USDC) which has been live in production for months.

For each customer address to be whitelisted:

* Is the Oracle data used in a permissioned manner that would prevent parasitic behavior?
Yes, the only contract intended to use this data is the same type of contract already using the BTC-USD data, which prevents public read-access of the data.
