## Application Form

### Domain Team Introduction

The Risk Domain team has been working for the betterment of the Maker Protocol, starting with Single-Collateral Dai and continuing to this day with Multi-Collateral Dai.

### Motivation

Working on the Risk side of things at MakerDAO together with Cyrus and the team now for one and half years, I believe I have a very good overview of the challenges in front of the Risk Domain. My main focus going forward would be:
- Maximize Protocol self-sustainability and robustness
- Scale Risk Teams: 
  - Build a independent structure of Risk analysts responsible directly to MakerDAO and compensated by the Protocol
  - Onboard additional regular contributors through mentoring and tasks
  - Make contributors specialize in Risk Domain fields i.e. monetary policy, peg & liquidity, collateral risk assessments, RWA, etc.
- More agile and effective collateral onboarding, focus on RWA
- Simplify Rate and Debt Ceiling setting process that enables collateral type scaling
- Enhance monitoring tools for Portfolio risk and DAI/Vault related metrics
- Address and monitor systemic DeFi risks
### Work Credentials
